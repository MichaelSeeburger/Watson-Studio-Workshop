# IBM Watson Studio hands on


It is easy to get started with Watson Studio. First of all, you need to login into [Watson Studio](https://eu-de.dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com). If you do not have a Watson Studio account use this [Account Setup](https://github.com/sumit-goyal/Watson-Studio-Workshop/wiki/Account-setup) guide to help you create one quickly.


After logging in you will see the overview page which gives you information about your previous activity and some tabs to get started with key tasks.
