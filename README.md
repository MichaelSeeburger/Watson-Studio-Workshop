# IBM Watson Studio hands on


It is easy to get started with Watson Studio. First of all, you need to login into [Watson Studio](https://eu-de.dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com). If you do not have a Watson Studio account use the [Account Setup](https://github.com/sumit-goyal/Watson-Studio-Workshop/wiki/Account-setup) guide to help you create one quickly.


# Create a Project
After logging in you will see the overview page which gives you information about your previous activity and some tabs to get started with key tasks.
